# Overview

This page presents an approach to generating road network skims for Analysis 
Assignment 4. Most of the instruction here is in the form of short videos, 
totalling about 23 minutes.

# Step 1: Download the GTFS feed for the transit network

This will be a zipped file containing several text files. You can usually
find the most recent version on the transit agency's website. Here are
some links for the study areas folks are working with this year:

* [Buffalo](https://www.nfta.com/metro/__googletransit/google_transit.zip)
* [Honolulu](http://webapps.thebus.org/transitdata/Production/google_transit.zip)
* [Jacksonville](https://schedules.jtafla.com/SchedulesGtfs/Download)
* [Okalahoma City](https://embarkok.com/data/gtfs/google_transit.zip)
* [Rochester](http://scheduledata.rgrta.com/google_transit.zip)

Check the contents of the zipped folder. You may find that there's a folder within the 
zipped folder, and that subfolder contains all the text files (I ran into this with 
the Jacksonville example). If that's the case, extract those text files zip them
into a new folder, so they're at the top level of a zipped folder.

# Step 2: Import transit routes and schedules from GTFS

Here is a video demonstrating how to import a GTFS feed into TransCAD.

# Step 3: Calculate average route headways

Here is a video demonstrating how to calculate average headways for the routes
in your transit network.

# Step 4: Add centroids and connectors to line layer

Here is a video reviewing how to add centroids and centroid connectors to a line 
layer.

# Step 5: Tag stops to nodes

To build the public transit network from your routes layer, you will need to identify
which stops (associated with the the routes layer) are closest to which nodes (associated
with the line layer). Here is a video demonstrating how to tag stops to nodes.

[Tagging stops to nodes](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/cepVQxl0Gks0GQLwPmVaRjiiPn578rL40lHcKMN4uZWavN2DMYZnQ2K_hU-f_CFV.qTIZkcgYLLSqUuW3?startTime=1675715297000){target="_blank"} (1:47) 

# Step 6: Calculate link walk times and in-vehicle travel times

You'll need to set values for each of three fields in the link file: 

* In-vehicle travel time (IVTT) (the time it takes for a transit vehicle to traverse a link)
* Walk time (the time it takes to walk along a link)
* Walk mode (an ID indicating the mode used to access transit)

Here is a video demonstrating how to set those values.

# Step 7: Create a public transport network

Now you are ready to create the network file. Here's a video that demonstrates how to do that.

# Step 8: Skim the public transport network

And finally, you can skim the public transit network.
