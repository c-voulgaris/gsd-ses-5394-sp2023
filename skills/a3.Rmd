# Overview

This page presents an approach to generating road network skims for Analysis 
Assignment 3. Most of the instruction here is in the form of short videos, 
totalling about an hour.

# Step 1: Download road network from OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap is a reasonably good source or routable street network data.
You can download OpenStreetMap data for your study area using
[https://extract.bbbike.org/](https://extract.bbbike.org/){target="_blank"}.

Click on the link below for a video walking through that process. In the 
video, I refer to an interactive leaflet map of my study area. You can find
an example of how to create an interactive leaflet map on the 
[skills page from Analysis Assignment 2](https://c-voulgaris.github.io/gsd-ses-5394-sp2023/skills/a2.html#create-an-interactive-map){target="_blank"}.

# Step 2: Export traffic analysis zone centroids

You should have a spatial data file with the boundaries of each of your
zone centroids. Here is a video that shows how to open a geojson file in
TransCAD and export it as a set of centroid points in the TransCAD file 
format.

[How do export zone centroids in TransCAD](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/1MrGljBuyph0i4Oh65dV91_J6DRLN_yqiv5lZKHo0p5cr9yAl3iyIMBI73IzciK-.-c2Kmr1l0_LGX9mK?startTime=1674071264000){target="_blank"}(2:21)

# Step 3: Import OpenStreetMap data to TransCAD

You'll need to import the roads data you downloaded from OpenStreetMap into
TransCAD. This is not difficult, but it does take a long time (in this example, it took about 25 minutes). Here is a 
short video that demonstrates the process.

[Importing OpenStreetMap data as a roads layer in TransCAD](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/EJouCappoIF-Drcq3hc-hfv1v28Iqdel-8lciquXqJcQCSmj1OD99rktwnYjpr5G.-glk0ZCCzTytfTOU?startTime=1674222689000){target="_blank"}(6:06)

# Step 4: Filter your road network by road type

OpenStreetMap datasets can contain one of several tags to indicate the 
something about each road segment's functional classification. TransCAD will 
save these in a column called "Type" when it imports OpenStreetMap data. You 
can see a list of possible roadway types here: [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway#Values](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway#Values){target="_blank"}.

Your zoning system probably isn't detailed enough to capture short, 
motorized trips. I recommend you only include the following road classes in
your network model (not all of these will necessarily be present in your
dataset):

* motorway
* trunk
* primary
* secondary
* tertiary
* motorway_link
* trunk_link
* primary_link
* secondary_link
* tertiary_link

Here's a short video that demonstrates how to select and delete roads
by functional class.

# Step 5: Add zones and centroids as layers to your TransCAD map

The next thing you'll want to do is add your traffic analysis zones 
and centroids to the same TransCAD map that shows your roads. Here
is a short video that demonstrates how to do that:

[Adding layers to a TransCAD map](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/nREd-VQZTC_c5OUXgHkaS08hXnqbXGiEaiUxaRZiWl8ihZ5AaI5r9inRdx76X9z3.oSKqAeYz9T37HHeO?startTime=1674225518000){target="_blank"}(2:39)

# Step 6: Trim the road network to your study area

In addition to containing lower functional classifications that 
what I need in my model, the initial OpenStreetMap dataset I downloaded
also includes a lot of roads I don't need, either because they are 
outside my study area or because they are not connected to the rest
of the network. This video shows how you would go through and 
delete those.

# Step 7: Create a centroid field for your road layer nodes

The next step is to add a column in the node layer associated with 
your roads layer to indicate which zones are centroids.

[Creating a centroid field](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/i-O7Hedx2xe2xCqsrQW3iBdSmTu2vpmr5-_U6iafORqPpELFoj7kERzwdpgHRv_J.yz2_ehm8N4UchxgK?startTime=1674235631000){target="_blank"}(3:03)

# Step 8: Add centroids and centroid connectors to your road layer

Next, you'll need to add centroids and centroid connectors to your 
roads layer.

[Creating centroids and connectors](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/4e7x_dGSRserrOWqikmCJdC5plSUyoSTUNAaWjz8lVLcZcdpDVL3Vsc2mUpWVCiy.0tlWz7NMrtNpIP2C?startTime=1674235911000){target="_blank"}(7:25)

# Step 9: Define vehicle speeds by road type

You'll need to define the travel speed for each roadway segment,
including the centroid connectors.

[Defining vehicle speeds](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/SlfXyiSNmPgdltdFOEoN72O1xEAqXjf6do9kvSWHQAxm4xbf8UHQT5DIyFRWuP-o.tfS2nMGGCXb4tyj4?startTime=1674236526000){target="_blank"}(7:46)

# Step 10: Calculate segment travel times

Next, you'll need to calculate the travel time for each segment.

[Calculating segment travel times](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/JNpeNRCOImZhI432m1WEkf5tUW-be-3APpBcfZyezVfa-2LRPnrO3EL35B4TurAX.Pb5EUMmibTaL0jpW?startTime=1674237061000){target="_blank"}(2:44)

# Step 11: Create a network from your road layer

Once you've have your road layer all set up, you'll use it to create
a network file.

[Generating a TransCAD network file](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/ZGxdQXh9ShmI9aWyfhZYN08GqnA1nZI_yT6jqbcXM9B0wG_ZQPnVJQ3JAUMEOiZr.DiERvnMMN9lrKjwa?startTime=1674240088000){target="_blank"}(1:52)

# Step 12: Skim the road network

Now you're finally ready to generate a travel time matrix.

[Skimming the road network](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/yPE5BpQ35cAsBdIcBSUhWxT3hNgjq9l9iokIxid9sQ4UI6tKIwLSwlRg7UjGKgU8.GOstFMIMXU-OCXsr?startTime=1674240286000){target="_blank"}(2:25)

# Step 13: Check for connectivity problems

If you produce a complete matrix on your first try, that's wonderful!
But it's more likely you'll have some connectivity problems you'll need
to investigate.

[Trouble-shooting connectivity problems](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/Tq90OCWViLNMEohHWdPmouyXJBIUwI2o0LVPGfwBTLwoQEErSa3694VbIMfapIWT.bNYNeVNr-okKx2eJ?startTime=1674243389000){target="_blank"}(8:33)

# Step 14: Iterate

It is unlikely you'll be able to create a complete set of skims
on your first try. You'll probably have to delete your centroids and
centroid connectors, then delete any links that might be causing 
problems (perhaps because they are not connected to the rest of the 
network at all, or because your centroid is only connected to one-way
links). Then you'll create new centroid connectors (maybe with more 
connectors per centroid), create a new network, and see if that network
is any more complete.
