# Overview

This page presents methods to applying a gravity model to 
generate a production-attraction matrix and some methods for 
visualizing production-attraction flows.

This tutorial demonstrates relies primarily on TransCAD to apply
the gravity model.
You can find [an alternative version that relies on R for all analysis here](https://c-voulgaris.github.io/gsd-ses-5394-sp2023/skills/a7-r.html){target="_blank"}.

I will be using R for some initial set-up, and I'll be using the following
packages: 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(srvyr)
library(knitr)
library(sf)
```


# Calculate average travel time by trip purpose

You'll want to check your results by comparing the average travel 
time for each trip purpose to the average travel time you observe
from your survey data.

I'll get the average travel time by trip purpose from the NHTS. First I download the data (if you have it saved on your computer from a previous assignment, you can also just load it from wherever you saved it before).

Then I filter to include only the households in my study area and to 
only include car trips (since I'm using a car skim for my travel times). 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
trips <- here("nhts",
     "trippub.csv") %>%
  read_csv(show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  filter(HH_CBSA == "15380") %>%
  filter(TRPTRANS == "03" | # Car
           TRPTRANS == "04" | # SUV
           TRPTRANS == "05" | # Van
           TRPTRANS == "06") # pickup truck 
```

Then I create a variable that specifies the trip purpose (as you did for Assignment 6).

```{r}
trips <- trips %>%
  mutate(home_based = case_when(WHYTO == "01" ~ TRUE,
                                WHYTO == "02" ~ TRUE,
                                WHYFROM == "01" ~ TRUE,
                                WHYFROM == "02" ~ TRUE,
                                TRUE ~ FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(work = ifelse(WHYTO == "03" | WHYFROM == "03", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(purpose = case_when(home_based & work ~ "HBW",
                            home_based ~ "HBO",
                            TRUE ~ "NHB"))
```


Then I create a survey object and calculate the average travel time by trip purpose.

```{r, message=FALSE}
trips_svy <- trips %>%
  filter(TRVLCMIN > 0) %>%
  as_survey(weights = WTTRDFIN)

ttime_by_purpose <- trips_svy %>%
  group_by(purpose) %>%
  summarise(avg_time = survey_mean(TRVLCMIN))

kable(ttime_by_purpose)
```

# Prepare production-attraction table

When you finished Assignment 6, you should have saved a table with 
the estimated number of productions and attractions in each zone.

I'll open a table here that should look something like what you ended
up with.

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
trip_gen <- here("Examples",
                 "rochester",
                 "trip-gen.geojson") %>%
  st_read() 

```

Here are the first few rows of that table

```{r}
kable(head(trip_gen))
```

To open this table correctly in TransCAD, you'll need to have a column with
a numeric ID column. I'll use the last 9 digits of the GEOID (if I 
use the full GEOID, the number will be too big).

For subsequent visualization, you might want to also create a column that
indicates which county each tract is in (with a numeric ID number). I'll make those additions and then
save a new geojson file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trip_gen %>%
  mutate(ID = as.integer(substr(GEOID, 3, 11))) %>%
  mutate(county_ID = as.numeric(substr(GEOID, 1, 5))) %>%
  mutate(county = case_when(county_ID == "36051" ~"Livingston",
                            county_ID == "36055" ~ "Monroe",
                            county_ID == "36069" ~ "Ontario",
                            county_ID == "36073" ~ "Orleans",
                            county_ID == "36117" ~ "Wayne",
                            TRUE ~ "Yates")) %>%
  st_write(here("Examples",
                "rochester",
                "trip-gen_with_ids.geojson"))
```

# Apply a gravity model in TransCAD

When you apply a gravity model in TransCAD, you will need to select
one of three types of deterrence function:

* Exponential function
* Inverse (power) function
* Gamma function

## Exponential function 

The exponential function is:

$F_{ijp} = e^{-ct_{ij}}$

where $F_{ij}$ is the friction factor for trips with purpose p between zone i and zone j, $t_{ij}$ is the the travel time from zone i to zone j. 

If you choose a exponential function in TransCAD, you will need to select
a value for c. 

## Inverse (power) function

The inverse (or power) function is:

$F_{ijp} = t_{ij}^{-b}$

where $F_{ij}$ is the friction factor for trips with purpose p between zone i and zone j, $t_{ij}$ is the the travel time from zone i to zone j, and a common value for _b_ would be 2 (for consistency with the Law of Gravity, which is the inspiration for the gravity model), but you can 
select any value. 

## Gamma function

The Gamma function is also called the combined function, since it's just the product of the power function and the exponential function. It can be written as:

$F_{ijp} = (a)t_{ij}^{b}e^{ct_{ij}}$

where $F_{ij}$ is the friction factor for trips with purpose p between zone i and zone j, $t_{ij}$ is the the travel time from zone i to zone j, and b and c are calibration parameters that you'll need to 
specify in TransCAD. 

Table 4.5 of NCHRP 716 (reproduced below for your convenience) offers example values for b and c used by seven MPOs that use a gamma function for the trip distribution step of their regional travel demand model. 

![](NCHRP-4-5.png)

All of you are working in study areas with more than a million people, which qualifies as a Large MPO, so choosing values from Large MPO 1, 2, or 3 might be a reasonable starting point. They're shown in the table above as negative numbers, but you should enter them as positive numbers in TransCAD. You will also need to speficy a value for _a_.

Here is video showing how to apply a gravity model in TransCAD.

[Applying a gravity model in TransCAD](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/kudGMGZAx447KH-rhEXHoQ4gpYh-aUh90X-p2QrODV63hKpYsijL1yR4a4BcPpY.VG9zqQS4goKakYTV?startTime=1677689782000){target="_blank"}

# Compare average trip lengths

Here's a video that demonstrates how to calculate average trip lengths
from a PA matrix and travel time skim in TransCAD.

[Calculating average travel time](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/aNSe129SUmxDQ_t4uhjE_6Aqt1RwmZzRj4PQ6jInTUGWrRyuniOEv0L6zr3n1BUz.KbLPHfNGAbwrECBi?startTime=1677691901000){target = "_blank"}

Our model produced an average travel time of about 17 minutes for HBO trips.
Recall that the survey suggests that the average travel time for HBO trips is 
about 16 minutes. That's probably close enough, but I could try a adjusting the
parameter(s) to get it a little closer, or choosing a different type of deterrence 
function (like a power function or a gamma function). 

# Aggregate matrix flows

To more easily visualize travel flows within your model, it will be helpful to aggregate your traffic analysis zones into larger areas, such 
as counties.

Hear's a video to demonstrate how to aggregate a production-attraction
matrix in TransCAD.

# Visualize aggregated flows

TransCAD has some nice tools for visualizing travel flows between
locations.
