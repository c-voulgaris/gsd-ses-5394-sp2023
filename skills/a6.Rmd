# Overview

This page presents an approach to estimating a trip production model based on data from the National Household Travel Survey, applying that model to estimate the number of trips produced by each zone, applying a trip attraction model to estimate the number of trips attracted by each zone, 
and balancing productions and attractions.

The examples here use the following packages:

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(downloader)
library(tidycensus)
library(sf)
```

# Download data from the National Household Travel Survey

You can download the full 2017 NHTS datasets using the code
below, or you can just navigate your browser to the url, 
download the zipped file from there, and then extract the files
to the directory where you want to save them
(that would probably be faster).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "https://nhts.ornl.gov/assets/2016/download/csv.zip"
nhts_zipped <- here("nhts.zip")
nhts_dir <- here("nhts")

download(url, nhts_zipped, mode="wb") 
unzip(nhts_zipped, exdir = nhts_dir)
```

The extracted directory will have the following files:

* Citation.docx
* hhpub.csv
* perpub.csv
* trippub.csv
* vehpub.csv

# Load trips table and filter to study area

You will likely be primarily working with the trips file
(trippub.csv). You will want to load this to R and filter to 
only include trips by households in your study area.

Use the 
[interactive codebook browser](https://nhts.ornl.gov/tables09/CodebookBrowser.aspx){target="_blank"} 
to find the code for your
study area (the variable will be HH_CBSA).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
okc_trips <- here("nhts",
                  "trippub.csv") %>%
  read_csv() %>%
  filter(HH_CBSA == "36420")
```

Core-based statistical areas with populations less than one 
million will not be specified in the public dataset, and 
Honolulu falls just below this threshold. However, it is the 
only MSA in Hawaii with a population greater than 500,000, so you can filter for it based on state and MSA size category.

```{r, message=FALSE}
hnlulu_trips <- here("nhts",
                     "trippub.csv") %>%
  read_csv() %>%
  filter(HHSTATE == "HI" &
           MSASIZE == "03")
```

# Filter out non-motorized trips

If your model does not include walk and bike trips, you should
filter these out.

```{r}
hnlulu_trips <- hnlulu_trips %>%
  filter(TRPTRANS != "01" & # Walk
           TRPTRANS != "02" & # Bike
           TRPTRANS != "19") # Airplane
```


# Count trips by trip purpose

Your model should include the following trip purposes:

* Home-based work (HBW)
* Home-based other (HBO)
* Non-home-based (NHB)

Classify trips into one of these three categories.

```{r}
hnlulu_trips <- hnlulu_trips %>%
  mutate(home_based = (WHYFROM == "01" |
                         WHYFROM == "02" |
                         WHYTO == "01" |
                         WHYTO == "02"),
         work = (WHYFROM == "03" |
           WHYTO == "03")) %>%
  mutate(purpose = case_when(home_based & work ~ "HBW",
                             home_based ~ "HBO",
                             TRUE ~ "NHB"))
```

You can quickly check how many of the total trips in your
study area fall into each category.

```{r}
table(hnlulu_trips$purpose)
```

In this example, we see that just over half of all trips are
in the "home-based other" category. Now we want to see how
many trips of each type each household makes.

```{r}
hh_trip_counts <- hnlulu_trips %>%
  group_by(HOUSEID) %>%
  summarise(HBO_trips = sum(purpose == "HBO"),
            HBW_trips = sum(purpose == "HBW"),
            NHB_trips = sum(purpose == "NHB"))
```

# Load household data

The trips file includes most of the household-level data you'd
need, but it won't include households that made no survey-day
trips, so it's better to get this by joining your trip counts
to the household file.

First you can load the household data and filter it the same way
you did for the trips. Then you can join the trip counts. 
Households with no trips won't have been in the trips file, so
you can replace the resulting NA values with zeros.

```{r, message=FALSE}
hnlulu_hhs <- here("nhts",
                     "hhpub.csv") %>%
  read_csv() %>%
  filter(HHSTATE == "HI" &
           MSASIZE == "03") %>%
  left_join(hh_trip_counts) %>%
  replace_na(list(HBO_trips = 0,
                  HBW_trips = 0,
                  NHB_trips = 0))
```

# Select (and create) variables

Spend some time browsing through the codebook and you'll find 
a lot of interesting variables that might be interesting 
predictors of trip generation, or travel behvior more generally.

You'll need to limit yourself to variables that have zone-level
analogs you can get from the census.

Let's say the data you've collected about each zone includes:

* Median income
* Number of zero-vehicle households
* Number of one-vehicle households
* Number of households with two or more vehicles
* Number of households with children

You would want to estimate a model that predicts the number of
household trip productions for each trip purpose based on 

* Household income
* The presence of a household vehicle
* The presence of household children

The NHTS presents income in one of eleven categories. I'll use 
the mid-point of each category to generate a continuous variable
indicating the household income in thousands. I'll have to make 
a guess for the midpoint of the top category ($200,000 or more).
I'm just going to use $300,000 - but this is a totally arbitrary
decision.

```{r}
hnlulu_hhs <- hnlulu_hhs %>%
  mutate(inc_k = case_when(HHFAMINC == "01" ~ 5,
                           HHFAMINC == "02" ~ 12.5,
                           HHFAMINC == "03" ~ 17.5,
                           HHFAMINC == "04" ~ 20,
                           HHFAMINC == "05" ~ 37.5,
                           HHFAMINC == "06" ~ 62.5,
                           HHFAMINC == "07" ~ 82.5,
                           HHFAMINC == "08" ~ 112.5,
                           HHFAMINC == "09" ~ 132.5,
                           HHFAMINC == "10" ~ 175,
                           HHFAMINC == "11" ~ 300,
                           TRUE ~ 99)) %>%
  mutate(inc_k = na_if(inc_k, 99))
```

And I'll create a categorical variable for vehicle ownership.

```{r}
hnlulu_hhs <- hnlulu_hhs %>%
  mutate(veh_cat = case_when(HHVEHCNT == 0 ~ "zero",
                             HHVEHCNT == 1 ~ "one",
                             TRUE ~ "two-plus"))
```

And a binary variable for whether there are children in the
household.

```{r}
hnlulu_hhs <- hnlulu_hhs %>%
  mutate(any_kids = LIF_CYC != "01" &
                    LIF_CYC != "02" &
                    LIF_CYC != "09" &
                    LIF_CYC != "10")
```

# Estimate a linear regression model

Now you can estimate a linear regression model for each trip 
purpose. I'm log-transforming income because I expect that
a percent. I'm using a base-two log so that I can interpret 
the coefficient as the effect of doubling income.

```{r}
hbo_trip_prod <- lm(HBO_trips ~ log2(inc_k) +
                                veh_cat +
                                any_kids,
                    data = hnlulu_hhs)
```

And here are the model results:

```{r}
summary(hbo_trip_prod)
```

The intercept is 1.18. This is the predicted number
of daily trips for a household with an annual income of $1,000
per year (so the base-two logarithm of the income, in thousands,
is zero), with one vehicle and no children.

A doubling of income is associated with 0.17 additional 
"home-based other" trips per day, although this effect is not
significant at a 95-percent (or even a 65-percent) confidence
level. 

Households with two or more vehicles make 1.3 more trips per day
than households with one vehicle. Households with no vehicles 
make fewer trips per day than those with one vehicle, but this 
difference is not significant at even an 80 percent confidence
level.

Households with children make, on average, 2.5 more daily trips
than those without children, holding income and vehicle access
constant.

What would be the predicted number of daily home-based other 
trips for a household with an annual income of $32,000 per 
year, two vehicles, and children living at home?

32 is $2^5$, so, this would be:

$1.18 + (5\times0.17) + 1.34 + 2.5$ or 5.9 trips.

This is the number of _trips produced_ by that household, or 
number of daily trip productions.

# Load zonal household data

I'll start by loading a dataset with the following variables:

* Number of households
* Number of households with a child present
* Number of households with zero vehicles
* Number of households with one vehicle
* Median household income

You may already have a dataset like this assembled from the second
analysis assignment, but I'll load it here directly from tidycensus.

Median income isn't reported for tracts with small sample sizes - so I'm missing 
that value for about ten tracts. I'll go ahead and replace those missing values 
with the study area median.

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
vars <- c(tot_hhs = "B11005_001",
          hhs_with_kids = "B11005_002",
          hhs_0_veh = "B08201_002",
          hhs_1_veh = "B08201_003",
          med_inc = "B19113_001")

median_study_area_income <- get_acs(year = 2019,
                                    geography = "cbsa",
                                    variables = "B19113_001") %>%
  filter(NAME == "Oklahoma City, OK Metro Area")

# Load TAZs
okc_zones <- get_acs(year = 2019, 
                     state = "OK",
                     county = c("Canadian",
                                    "cleveland",
                                    "Grady",
                                    "Lincoln",
                                    "Logan",
                                    "McClain",
                                    "Oklahoma"),
                     variables = vars,
                     geography = "tract",
                     geometry = TRUE,
                     output = "wide") %>%
  replace_na(replace = list(med_incE = median_study_area_income$estimate[1]))
```

# Calculate trip productions from trip production models

Let's say I previously estimated this trip production model for 
home-based other trips:

![](prod-model.png)

I can use that to estimate the total number of trip 
productions per household for each zone.

```{r}
okc_zones <- okc_zones %>%
  mutate(hhs_2plus_veh = tot_hhsE - hhs_0_vehE - hhs_1_vehE) %>%
  mutate(hbo_prod_per_hh = 0.7199 + 
                           0.2121 * log2(med_incE) + 
                           1.4369 * ((hhs_2plus_veh)/tot_hhsE) -
                           0.2263 * (hhs_0_vehE/tot_hhsE) +
                           1.7883 * (hhs_with_kidsE/tot_hhsE))
```

And then I can multiply that by the number of households in each zone.

```{r}
okc_zones <- okc_zones %>%
  mutate(hbo_trip_prod = tot_hhsE * hbo_prod_per_hh)
```

# Load employment data

Now I'll load the employment data and join it to my household data 
(again, you will have already done this).

```{r}
lehd_blocks <- read_csv('https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/lodes/LODES7/ok/wac/ok_wac_S000_JT00_2019.csv.gz', 
                        show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  rename(total_emp = C000) %>%
  mutate(basic_emp = CNS01+CNS02+CNS03+CNS04+CNS05+CNS06+CNS08+CNS09) %>%
  rename(retail_emp = CNS07) %>%
  mutate(service_emp = total_emp - basic_emp - retail_emp) %>%
  select(w_geocode, total_emp, basic_emp, retail_emp, service_emp)

lehd_tracts <- lehd_blocks %>%
  mutate(w_geocode = as.character(w_geocode)) %>%
  mutate(GEOID = substr(w_geocode, 1, 11)) %>%
  select(-w_geocode) %>%
  group_by(GEOID) %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), ~sum(.)))

okc_zones <- okc_zones %>%
  left_join(lehd_tracts)
```

# Calculate trip attractions from trip attraction models

You don't have great data for estimating a trip attraction model (this isn't 
unusual), so we're just going to use parameters from 
[NCHRP 716](https://www.trb.org/Publications/Blurbs/167055.aspx){target="_blank"}. 

![](NCHRP_716_4-4.png)

Model 3 for motorized person trips is appropriate to the data we have for
home-based non-work trips (since we don't have school enrollment data).

```{r}
okc_zones <- okc_zones %>%
  mutate(hbo_trip_attr = 1.0 * tot_hhsE +
                         0.3 * basic_emp +
                         5.9 * retail_emp +
                         2.3 * service_emp)
```

# Balance productions and attractions

How many total trip productions did I estimate for the entire 
study area?

```{r}
sum(okc_zones$hbo_trip_prod)
```

And how many total trip attractions did I estimate?

```{r}
sum(okc_zones$hbo_trip_attr)
```

This isn't terribly surprising, but it is a problem. Every trip needs
to have one production and one attraction, so the number of productions
should be equal to the number of attractions. I'll need to balance
productions and attractions.

In general, my trip production model will be based on better, more recent
data than my trip attraction model, so one sensible approach would be to 
take the total number of trip productions as "true" and scale the trip 
attractions up to that number.

```{r}
okc_zones <- okc_zones %>%
  mutate(hbo_bal_attr = hbo_trip_attr * 
           sum(hbo_trip_prod) / sum(hbo_trip_attr))
```

Now I can confirm that the adjusted trip attractions do sum to the
total number of trip productions.

```{r}
sum(okc_zones$hbo_bal_attr)
```

# Save your results

You'll need to open a layer of zones with balanced productions and
attractions in TransCAD for the trip distribution step, so you should 
export that result as a geojson file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
okc_zones %>%
  select(GEOID, hbo_trip_prod, hbo_trip_attr) %>%
  st_write(here("Examples",
                "OKC",
                "trip-gen.geojson"))
```
